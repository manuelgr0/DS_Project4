Several choices have to be made that limit the reach of our application, in order to keep the project simple enough for the given time frame. Perhaps the choice that limits us most is using the Wi-Fi Peer-to-Peer API in Android. It constrains us to devices that have at least Android 4 (API level 14) installed and that have hardware capable of Wi-Fi Direct communication.\cite{APIGuides}
