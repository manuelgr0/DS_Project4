		\subsection{API}
		The API will offer the following functionalities to clients:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item {Initialize network}
			\item {Join network}
			\item {Leave network}
			\item {Broadcast message}
			\item {Register receive message listener}
		\end{itemize}
		In this section, we discuss how we plan to support these functionalities. But before starting with that, we should have a look at
		what a network is to us and how it is defined.\\
		Our system is supposed to be fully symmetric, i.e. there is no device (node) in the network with a special task, all nodes execute the same code. In particular, all nodes can send and receive message at any point in time new nodes can join the network by extending it at any node that is already integrated in the network.\\
		So, what is a network in our case? Let the pair $a(A,B)$ denote an established conection between node $A$ to node $B$. We consider the known network of a node $C$ to be the set of all nodes $N_i, (1 \leq i \leq \text{\# of nodes})$ for which holds:  \\
		There is a chain of established connections for some $n$ and a given timeout $t$
		\begin{displaymath}
			a_0(N_{i},N_{j_0}) \circ a_1(N_{j_0},N_{j_1}) \circ \ldots \circ a_{n+1}(N_{i_n},C)
		\end{displaymath}
		such that $a_k$ happened before $a_{k+1}$ for all $k \leq n$ and $a_0$ is not older than the timeout $t$ allows. \\
		Informally, the network as seen by a given device consits of all nodes whose signal could reach the device within the predefined timeout. \\

		\subsection{Emergency App}
		Claude, Alessandro
		
		\subsection{Chat App}
		Joel, Pascal
			
			The Chat App ensures end to end encrypted messages via peer-to-peer connection through the flooding API. Encrypting and Decrypting messages is done public key cryptography. The keys are generated by the user and shared by QR codes that have to be scanned from the receiver.\\
			If the receiver's network is not connected to the sender's network the messages are buffered and will be sent to the receiver later when the receiver's and the sender's network are connected. The receiver is able to get as many messages as are stored in the buffer.\\
			
			When first starting the App the user has to enter his name and generate his public and private key. After generating the key the user is able to scan public keys from other members or provide his own public key for scanning. Upon scanning a new chat is displayed in the chat-list and a reminder appears to scan the public key of the chat partner. \\
			
			For group chats symmetric keys are used. Every chat will have an administrator who generates a symmetric key and can distribute the key to other group members.\\
			
			Pressing on a chat in the chat-list opens a chat to write and read messages.\\
